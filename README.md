### Looks like you're hitting a GPG key verification issue, which is preventing the update from completing successfully. This happens when the public key required to verify the repository's authenticity is missing.

### Fix: Manually Add the Missing GPG Key
### Try running this command to add the missing key:

```bash
sudo apt-key adv --keyserver keyserver.ubuntu.com --recv-keys ED65462EC8D5E4C5
```
If apt-key is deprecated in your version, use this alternative approach:

```bash
sudo gpg --keyserver keyserver.ubuntu.com --recv-keys ED65462EC8D5E4C5
sudo gpg --export ED65462EC8D5E4C5 | sudo tee /etc/apt/trusted.gpg.d/kali.asc
sudo apt update -y && sudo apt upgrade -y
```

### Then, Retry the Update
```bash
sudo apt update -y && sudo apt upgrade -y
```

### If the issue persists, you can try clearing the package lists and refreshing the repositories:

```bash
sudo rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*
sudo apt update -y && sudo apt upgrade -y
```
Let me know if that works or if you need more troubleshooting! ðŸš€
